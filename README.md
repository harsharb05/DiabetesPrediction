# Diabetes Prediction Using ML Models

This Python project is aimed at predicting diabetes using machine learning models. The project includes a `.pkl` file that stores 5 trained models, and the highest accuracy model is used to make predictions.

## Project Structure

- `models/`: This folder will contain the trained models saved as `.pkl` files.
- `app.py`: The main Python script that loads the best model and makes predictions.
- `data/`: Dataset used for training the models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies to run the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib` (for loading `.pkl` files)
